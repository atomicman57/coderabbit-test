# CodeRabbit Demo Project

This project is intentionally created with various code quality issues to demonstrate CodeRabbit's capabilities in identifying and suggesting fixes for common code problems.

## Issues Included

This project contains various issues commonly found in TypeScript/JavaScript codebases, including:

1. **Code Style Issues**
   - Mixed quote styles
   - Missing semicolons
   - Inconsistent formatting

2. **Potential Bugs**
   - Null references
   - Unused variables
   - Unreachable code
   - Inconsistent return types

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Inefficient loops
   - Memory leaks
   - Synchronous file operations

4. **Security Issues**
   - Hard-coded API keys
   - Use of eval
   - Inadequate error handling

5. **Best Practices Violations**
   - Magic numbers
   - Overly complex functions
   - Type issues (use of 'any')

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run linting to see the issues:
   ```
   npm run lint
   ```

3. Try to build the project:
